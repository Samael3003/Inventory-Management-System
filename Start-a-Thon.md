"Automated Inventory &amp; Environment Monitoring"

## Problem Statement Details 

Effective inventory management is a critical challenge for companies of all sizes and across all sectors. Manual inventory monitoring, antiquated data collection techniques, and a lack of real-time visibility can result in inefficiencies, mistakes, and higher expenses. Losses in money, a decline in customer happiness, and a hindrance to business expansion can all be brought on by overstocking or stockouts. Additionally, maintaining ideal storage conditions for delicate or perishable commodities is difficult due to the risk of product degradation, waste, and non-compliance with regulations.

## Relevance, Significance and Survey

### Customer Satisfaction: 
According to a poll by IHL Group, 24% of shoppers in physical stores reported encountering stockouts, and 30% of those shoppers left the store without making a purchase as a result. In addition, 42% of customers said they would not go back to a business where they had a stockout experience. This emphasises how important it is for inventory to be available and for customers to be satisfied. Businesses may improve customer experiences, keep customers' loyalty, and increase income by using our Inventory Management System to ensure correct inventory monitoring and replenishment. (Reference: IHL Group, "Out-of-Stock, Out of Luck 2019")

### Financial Impact: 
According to a National Retail Federation (NRF) report, merchants will lose an average of 1.62% of their overall sales due to inventory shrinkage in 2020. This $61 billion loss is attributable to things like staff theft, shoplifting, administrative mistakes, and improper inventory monitoring. By giving real-time visibility into inventory levels, identifying discrepancies, and permitting proactive measures to prevent shrinkage, the deployment of an effective Inventory Management and Monitoring System can considerably reduce these losses. (Refer to the National Retail Federation's "National Retail Security Survey 2020")

## Proposed Solution 
Our suggested remedy is a sophisticated Inventory Management and Monitoring System that makes use of cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) technology, automation, and real-time data analysis to successfully address the issues brought on by conventional inventory management procedures. To deliver a comprehensive and thoughtful solution, our method includes the integration of physical elements, software systems, and data analytics.
Our strategy integrates three crucial phases employing embedded devices, including the Node MCU ESP8266, Raspberry Pi 4B, and Arduino Uno R3. As a result of each stage's distinct contributions to the system as a whole, real-time inventory monitoring, environmental monitoring, safety control, and automatic notifications are all possible.

## Frameworks/Technologies:

### IoT Platform: 
  ThingSpeak for real-time data storage and visualization.
### Communication Protocols: 
  Wi-Fi communication for real-time data exchange.
### Programming Languages: 
  Arduino C++, Python, and relevant libraries for sensor interfacing and control.
### Data Analysis: 
  Basic data analysis using embedded platforms for demand pattern insights.
### Wireless Sensor Integration: 
  Utilizing wireless communication for real-time data exchange, reducing the need for manual data collection.
### Environmental Monitoring: 
  Incorporating gas and temperature sensors to enhance safety and compliance.
### Automated Billing: 
  Implementing an automated billing system based on real-time item quantity measurements.

## Key Feature and Functionality

### Real-Time Inventory Monitoring: 
The system employs ultrasonic sensors and Node MCU ESP8266 to provide accurate, real-time monitoring of inventory levels. This ensures businesses always have up-to-date information on stock quantities.
### Automated Notifications: 
When inventory levels reach predefined thresholds, the system sends automated email notifications to relevant stakeholders, prompting timely stock replenishment and minimizing the risk of stockouts.
### Environmental Monitoring: 
Utilizing Raspberry Pi 4B, the system continuously tracks temperature and gas levels within the storage area. This proactive monitoring ensures optimal storage conditions, reducing the likelihood of product spoilage or damage.
### Bill Generation and Emailing: 
Raspberry Pi 4B calculates total quantities of items purchased and generates automated bills for customers. The generated bills are then emailed to customers, streamlining the billing process and enhancing customer satisfaction.




### Ultrasonic Sensor and Inventory Management (Python):

This code segment is for managing an inventory using ultrasonic distance sensors with a Raspberry Pi. It allows you to scan items' distances using the sensors, print the current inventory, save a bill, and quit the program. The inventory management is basic and relies on the distances measured by the sensors to represent the quantity of items.

### Temperature, Gas, and Humidity Monitoring (Arduino):

This code is written for an Arduino board with a temperature sensor and a gas sensor. It displays temperature, humidity, and gas levels on an LCD screen. If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, it activates a fan to cool the system. This code also uses ThingSpeak to send data to a cloud service for further analysis.

### Product Quantity Monitoring (ESP8266):

This code is designed to work with an ESP8266 board, two ultrasonic sensors, and ThingSpeak. It monitors the quantity of two different products (Ice Cream and Chocolate) using ultrasonic sensors and sends the data to ThingSpeak. Depending on the measured distance, the product quantities are determined and updated on the ThingSpeak channel.






 ## Market Size and Potential for Growth

**The increasing usage of automation and IoT technologies has been a major driver of the worldwide inventory management software market's steady growth. The market is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.3% from 2017 to 2027, when it is expected to reach USD 4.11 billion. The need for cutting-edge solutions like ours is anticipated to increase as businesses realise how important efficient inventory management is, particularly among small and medium-sized organisations striving to boost operational effectiveness.**

## Real-Time Monitoring and Automation: 
**Our system offers real-time inventory monitoring using IoT capabilities, enabling businesses to make informed decisions promptly. Unlike traditional software, our solution automates notifications for stock replenishment and environmental alerts, reducing manual intervention and minimizing stockouts.**

### Competitive Landscape :
Key competitors in the market include established inventory management software providers, as well as emerging IoT-based solutions. While there are several players offering inventory management software, our solution differentiates itself in the following ways:

### Integration of Multiple Platforms: 
Our system leverages the strengths of Node MCU ESP8266, Raspberry Pi 4B, and Arduino Uno R3, combining their capabilities for a comprehensive solution. This unique integration allows for a more holistic approach to inventory management, enabling functionalities such as real-time inventory monitoring, environmental control, and automated billing.

## Financial Projections and Funding Ask:

**As of now, it appears that the Prototype is in its development stage and has not yet started generating revenue. Therefore, financial projections would be speculative. However, once the Prototype Model is ready for market launch, we would prepare a detailed financial projections covering sales forecasts, costs, and potential revenue from device sales, subscriptions, and licensing.**

## Future Prospects

**In the coming years, we envision our inventory management solution evolving into a market leader by scaling its user base, integrating advanced technologies like AI and machine learning, fostering global partnerships, and diversifying revenue streams through data monetization and premium analytics services, all while maintaining a strong focus on sustainability, mobile accessibility, and community engagement to solidify our position as a comprehensive and forward-looking solution for businesses seeking efficient, data-driven inventory management.**

## Usage

### Python (.py) file for Automatic Billing (Raspberry Pi 4B)

**Hardware Setup:** Ensure your Raspberry Pi 4B is properly set up and connected to the necessary peripherals, such as a barcode scanner or camera for scanning inventory items.

**Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have all the required libraries and dependencies installed on your Raspberry Pi. You may need to run `pip install` commands for any missing packages.

**Run the Python Script:** Execute the Python script on your Raspberry Pi. This script should continuously monitor the inventory and generate bills automatically when items are scanned or detected as sold. Ensure that it's running in the background or as a service as needed.

### Arduino (.ino) file for Environment Monitoring

**Hardware Setup:** Upload the Arduino (.ino) code to your Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) using the Arduino IDE. Connect the necessary sensors and actuators as per your hardware setup.

**Calibration:** Depending on the sensors used, you might need to calibrate them according to your environment. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for calibration.

**Power Up:** Power up your Arduino board and ensure it's connected to a suitable power source. The code should start collecting environmental data as programmed.

### Arduino (.ino) file for Inventory Stock Management (NodeMCU ESP8266)

**Hardware Setup:** Upload the Arduino (.ino) code to your NodeMCU ESP8266 board using the Arduino IDE. Connect any required sensors, RFID readers, or other inventory monitoring hardware.

**Configure Wi-Fi:** Modify the code to include your Wi-Fi credentials and network details so that the NodeMCU can connect to your network.

**Inventory Management:** This code should monitor and manage your inventory. It may send alerts or updates to a central system when stock runs low or when items are added or removed.
